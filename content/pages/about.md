# In Brief

* [Here](https://www.notion.so/Ramkumar-Venkataraman-0eab07d8c67141c885cee83bb1c91773) is a detailed version of my work (including some of my spectacular failures)
* Used to spend a lot of my free time reading [books](https://www.ramkumarvenkat.xyz/pages/books) across philosophy, business, history, science, astrophysics, and productivity. Currently, a part-time babysitter who reads books on parenting, influence, and incentives

# Ideas brewing in my mind

* Platforms and public support systems for the differently-abled in India. Most malls don't even have a wheelchair ramp and there is no lane separation on the roads
* End-of-life care in India (Palliative and Hospice). There is a lot of older generation who have their children emigrated to the west and spend their last days alone and without much support. The only alternative seems to be orphanages and selective communities for the financially well-off
* Health and fitness apps; high interest yielding accounts; online and offline communities - for people over the age of 60
* New-age private/micro/home-schooling (maybe aggregators) with a focus on independent thinking and customized syllabi
* Self-help groups, employment training, accessible banking and financial assistance (including micro-loans) for the poor to survive, sustain and grow
* The SaaS companies in Europe I talked to typically do the following: manage subscriptions in excel, using accounting software, optionally use Salesforce for CRM and dump everything to an excel file and do projections, planning and budgeting. There is definitely scope for a product that presents a holistic view of a subscription business and helps make decisions
* Robinhood marries Transferwise: imagine a trading app with zero commission fees and low exchange rates that lets investors in APAC/EMEA trade stocks in Nasdaq. There are a few platforms that let people wire money to a US bank account (hefty fees and slower) and they charge fees for every trade
* KYB is not automated in Europe (and from my experiences in TransferWise, it is true in Australia). Most companies have a manual process to download credit reports, check for PEP lists, etc. 
* Crowdfunding and private equity investing: there is simply no platform like Republic or CartaX that lets folks in India invest in local early-stage startups. There a few variants in the EU, but the portfolio isn't as strong as the US counterparts
* Savings app for teens with a focus on educational content, gamified multi-player experiences that promote group savings, etc. The current ecosystem for this cohort focuses on issuing cards (spending)
* A multi-player multi-format platform for novels - imagine Harry Potter co-written by 100+ people, with text, images, audio, and anime/video mashups taking the story forward. Now add to it AR/VR to give a complete sensory experience. Now let's make it a platform
* Documentation advisors - AI tools, mentorship for remote teams to set up practices for clear documentation and train employees to become better writers
