# In Brief
* Engineer & product in companies like TransferWise, PayPal, Amazon, and a few others
* [Here](https://www.notion.so/Ramkumar-Venkataraman-0eab07d8c67141c885cee83bb1c91773) is a detailed version of my work (including some of my spectacular failures)
* Raised in India, worked in Singapore for a while
* Used to spend a lot of my free time reading [books](https://www.ramkumarvenkat.xyz/pages/books) across philosophy, business, history, science, astrophysics, and productivity. Currently, a part-time babysitter who reads books on parenting, influence, and incentives
* [My utopian vision for the world](https://www.ramkumarvenkat.xyz/posts/vision)

# Current Work
* Building [Bridg](https://www.bridg.app/), a new financing model for startups with recurring revenues. The gist: SaaS companies in EMEA can trade their MRRs and get cash worth their annual value upfront. No equity dilution, high-interest VC debt, and discounting the annual plans
* Pro bono consulting and building an MVP for a new-age, multi-player, and a fun savings app

# Offers
* Have been engineering and PM'ing for a decade now. So I can definitely help in building an MVP, sharing perspectives about designing systems (both for MVP and for scale), some gotchas, and in general an attentive ear to bounce ideas
* Help share with my network in India and Singapore about your company, goals, and hiring plans

# Asks
* If you know any SaaS companies (post-PM-fit, in EMEA) looking to raise capital, please do send them my way
* Any help with bootstrapping a team from scratch, including engineers, marketing, sales, legal, and compliance
* Introductions to Investors who are deeply connected with B2B businesses and who know a thing or two about credit underwriting and risk management
* Feedback, advising, and mentoring on the product, tech, and building a company in general
* If there is a common thread about fin-tech and ideas for a better world, please DM me! I would love to have a few long-lasting connections with kind folks, who want to bring a positive change to the world

# Ideas brewing in my mind
* Platforms and public support systems for differently-abled in India. Most malls don't have a wheelchair ramp and there is no lane separation on the roads
* End-of-life care in India (Palliative and Hospice). There is a lot of older generation who have their children emigrated to the west and spend their last days alone and without much support. The only alternative seems to be orphanages and selective communities for the financially well-off
* New-age private/micro/home-schooling with focus on independent thinking and customized syllabi
* Self-help groups, employment training, accessible banking and financial assistance (including micro-loans) for the poor to survive, sustain and grow
* The SaaS companies in Europe we talked to typically do the following: manage subscriptions in excel, using accounting software, optionally use Salesforce for CRM and dump everything to an excel file and do projections, planning and budgeting. There is definitely scope for a product that presents a holistic view of a subscription business and helps make decisions
* Robinhood marries Transferwise: imagine a trading app with zero commission fees and low exchange rates that lets investors in APAC/EMEA trade stocks in Nasdaq. There are a few platforms that let people wire money to a US bank account (hefty fees and slower) and they charge fees for every trade
* Crowdfunding and private equity investing: there is simply no platform like Republic or CartaX that lets folks in India invest in local early-stage startups. There a few variants in the EU, but the portfolio isn't as strong as the US counterparts
