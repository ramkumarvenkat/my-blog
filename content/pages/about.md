# In Brief

* Engineer and PM for about 12 years in companies like ~~Transfer~~Wise, PayPal, Amazon, and others
* [Here](https://www.notion.so/Ramkumar-Venkataraman-0eab07d8c67141c885cee83bb1c91773) is a detailed version of my work (including some of my spectacular failures)
* Raised in India, worked in Singapore for a while
* Used to spend a lot of my free time reading [books](https://www.ramkumarvenkat.xyz/pages/books) across philosophy, business, history, science, astrophysics, and productivity. Currently, a part-time babysitter who reads books on parenting, influence, and incentives
* [My utopian vision for the world](https://www.ramkumarvenkat.xyz/posts/vision)

# Current Work

* Co-founder/CTO - [Bridg](https://www.bridg.app/), a new financing model for startups with recurring revenues. The gist: SaaS companies in EMEA can trade their MRRs and get cash worth their annual value upfront. No equity dilution, high-interest VC debt, and discounting the annual plans. **Status**: Early customers signed up; looking to acquire more customers, fundraise, setup founding team of engineers, marketing & sales
* Pro bono consulting: Multi-player savings app for consumers in the US: building an MVP, help with product strategy, and tech architecture. Status: raised seed funding; looking for full-stack engineers, game designers/engineers, and social/growth marketing

# Offers

* Have been engineering and PM'ing for a decade now. So I can definitely help in building an MVP, sharing perspectives about designing systems (both for MVP and for scale), some gotchas, and in general an attentive ear to bounce ideas
* If you're a founder or an investor, I can help share with my network in India, Singapore, and Europe about your company, goals, and hiring plans
* I am part of a few alumni groups in the previous companies I worked with - let me know if you need an introduction to the right person still working there

# Asks

* If you know any SaaS companies (post-PM-fit, in EMEA) looking to raise capital, please do send them my way
* Warm introductions to Investors who are deeply connected with B2B businesses and who have a shared empathy on the complexities of risk management and credit underwriting
* Help bootstrap a team from scratch, including engineers, marketing, sales, legal, and compliance
* Feedback, advising, and mentoring on the product, tech, and building a company in general
* If there is a common thread about fin-tech and ideas for a better world, please DM me! I would love to have a few long-lasting connections with kind folks, who want to bring a positive change to the world

# Ideas brewing in my mind

* Platforms and public support systems for differently-abled in India. Most malls don't have a wheelchair ramp and there is no lane separation on the roads
* End-of-life care in India (Palliative and Hospice). There is a lot of older generation who have their children emigrated to the west and spend their last days alone and without much support. The only alternative seems to be orphanages and selective communities for the financially well-off
* Health and fitness apps; high interest yielding accounts; online and offline communities - for people over the age of 60
* New-age private/micro/home-schooling with a focus on independent thinking and customized syllabi
* Self-help groups, employment training, accessible banking and financial assistance (including micro-loans) for the poor to survive, sustain and grow
* The SaaS companies in Europe we talked to typically do the following: manage subscriptions in excel, using accounting software, optionally use Salesforce for CRM and dump everything to an excel file and do projections, planning and budgeting. There is definitely scope for a product that presents a holistic view of a subscription business and helps make decisions
* Robinhood marries Transferwise: imagine a trading app with zero commission fees and low exchange rates that lets investors in APAC/EMEA trade stocks in Nasdaq. There are a few platforms that let people wire money to a US bank account (hefty fees and slower) and they charge fees for every trade
* Crowdfunding and private equity investing: there is simply no platform like Republic or CartaX that lets folks in India invest in local early-stage startups. There a few variants in the EU, but the portfolio isn't as strong as the US counterparts
* Savings app for teens with a focus on educational content, gamified multi-player experiences that promote group savings, etc. The current ecosystem for this cohort focuses on issuing cards (spending)
