# About Me

* Engineer & product in companies like TransferWise, PayPal, Amazon, and a few others
* [Here](https://www.notion.so/Ramkumar-Venkataraman-0eab07d8c67141c885cee83bb1c91773) is a detailed version of my work (including some of my spectacular failures)
* Living in India, worked for a while in Singapore
* Avid book reader

# What is keeping me busy right now

* Building [Bridg](https://www.bridg.app/), a new financing model for startups with recurring revenues. The gist: SaaS companies in EMEA can trade their MRRs and get cash worth their annual value upfront
* Pro bono consulting and building an MVP for a new-age, multi-player, and a fun savings app

# Things I dream about

A utopian world with access to the following fully democratized:

* Health: highest quality healthcare at the right time and at the right price
* Knowledge: access to the same education standards in the private, online, and home schools in the developed countries
* Wealth: elimination of poverty and sufficient wealth at the hands of entrepreneurs who can build this world

# Offers

* Have been engineering and PM'ing for a decade now. So I can definitely help in building an MVP, sharing perspectives about designing systems (both for MVP and for scale), some gotchas, and in general an attentive ear to bounce ideas
* Help share with my network in India and Singapore about your company, goals, and hiring plans

# Asks

* If you know SaaS companies (in EMEA) looking to raise capital, please do send them my way
* Any help with bootstrapping a team from scratch, including engineers, marketing, sales, legal, and compliance
* Introductions to investors who are deeply connected with B2B businesses and who know a thing or two about credit underwriting and risk management
* Advising and mentoring on product, tech, and building a company in general
* If there is a common thread about fin-tech and ideas for a better world, please DM me!
