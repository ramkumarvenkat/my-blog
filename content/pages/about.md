# In Brief

* Engineer & product in companies like TransferWise, PayPal, Amazon, and a few others
* [Here](https://www.notion.so/Ramkumar-Venkataraman-0eab07d8c67141c885cee83bb1c91773) is a detailed version of my work (including some of my spectacular failures)
* Raised in India, worked in Singapore for a while
* Used to spend a lot of my free time reading [books](https://www.ramkumarvenkat.xyz/pages/books) across philosophy, business, history, science, astrophysics, and productivity. Currently, a part-time babysitter who reads books on parenting, influence, and incentives

# Current Work

* Building [Bridg](https://www.bridg.app/), a new financing model for startups with recurring revenues. The gist: SaaS companies in EMEA can trade their MRRs and get cash worth their annual value upfront. No equity dilution, high-interest VC debt, and discounting the annual plans
* Pro bono consulting and building an MVP for a new-age, multi-player, and a fun savings app

# Offers

* Have been engineering and PM'ing for a decade now. So I can definitely help in building an MVP, sharing perspectives about designing systems (both for MVP and for scale), some gotchas, and in general an attentive ear to bounce ideas
* Help share with my network in India and Singapore about your company, goals, and hiring plans

# Asks

* If you know any SaaS companies (post-PM-fit, in EMEA) looking to raise capital, please do send them my way
* Any help with bootstrapping a team from scratch, including engineers, marketing, sales, legal, and compliance
* Introductions to Investors who are deeply connected with B2B businesses and who know a thing or two about credit underwriting and risk management
* Feedback, advising, and mentoring on the product, tech, and building a company in general
* If there is a common thread about fin-tech and ideas for a better world, please DM me! I would love to have a few long-lasting connections with kind folks, who want to bring a positive change to the world
