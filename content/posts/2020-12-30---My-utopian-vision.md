I would only want the following 3 to be democratized (in the order):

1. Health
2. Knowledge
3. Wealth

# Health

A world where quality healthcare is easily accessible. I've had the sad privilege to watch 2 of the people I loved not make it in this world. My grandmother first and then a stillborn. All because of some poor decision-making from specialists and lack of quality accessible healthcare. 

# Knowledge

Some of the best innovations in private schooling are happening as we speak (ala Synthesis, Prisma, etc.) I want a world where quality education fostered in developed countries, be made accessible across the world. Internet and distribution FTW.

My schooling was all about rote learning. I would never question the things presented nor take the risks to try something bold. I was taught to blindly believe in traditions without seeking the truth. So the kind of education I want to see for my son is one that fosters independent thinking and an attitude of rigorous questioning

# Wealth

A world where no one lives below the poverty line. 

A world where entrepreneurs and folks with skin-in-the-game are blessed with sufficient wealth that they build and invest in companies that make healthcare, knowledge, and wealth accessible. And the flywheel continues.

I still remember my early childhood days living in a cramped 300 sq. ft apartment, studying hard, and watching my parents sweat. But we were far better than a large percentage of the population in India. This has to change and people have the basic right to live a sustainable and a healthy life
